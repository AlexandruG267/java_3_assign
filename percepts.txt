#Every cycle at the sense step, the world generates percepts and returns to the agent a knowlegde base called the percept base.
#After this, inference is done on the union of the percept rules (this file), the agent's beliefs and the percept base.
#Every cycle your percept base changes, reflecting the current state the agent is in. 
#If you want to remember things from previous percepts, you have to build rules to do so.
#This is the purpose of the percept rules.
#Such rules typically add or delete beliefs, this is done with + and - operators.
#Add your percept rules below:

# If at location X and see passage to Y, remember the link
at(X)&passage(Y) > +link(X,Y)

# If at location X and see key K, remember key location
at(X)&key(K) > +keyAt(X,K)

# If at location X and see locked door D, remember the door location
at(X)&locked(D) > +lockedDoor(X,D)

# Update the current location in the belief base
at(X) > +agentAt(X)
